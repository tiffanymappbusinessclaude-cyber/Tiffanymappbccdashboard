-- ============================================================
-- BCC Schema Audit Query (diagnostic, NOT a DDL migration)
-- ============================================================
-- (Moved from supabase/migrations/007_schema_audit.sql in May 2026
--  to clarify that this is a diagnostic SELECT query, not a DDL
--  migration. Migrations are numbered 001-010; this query lives
--  in tools/ alongside the build-time schema-audit.js.)
--
-- Run this in the client's Supabase Studio SQL Editor during a
-- Path A (existing-database) install. It returns ~40 rows in three
-- sections:
--   1. TABLE AUDIT  — one per master table, status = ok / bridge_needed / missing
--   2. VIEW AUDIT   — v_income_statement and v_balance_sheet status
--   3. ANON ACCESS  — does the anon role have read grants
--
-- Read the result like this:
--   ok           → nothing to do
--   bridge_needed → legacy table exists; the legacy_name column tells
--                   you what to alias when calling bcc_generate_bridges()
--   missing       → run the matching migration or build a bridge
--
-- After running, see SCHEMA_NORMALIZATION_RUNBOOK.md for what to do
-- with each row.
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- BCC SCHEMA NORMALIZATION AUDIT
-- Run this ONCE in client Supabase Studio.
-- Returns 37 rows, one per master table, telling you exactly
-- what to do for each: nothing (ok), bridge a legacy name,
-- or apply a migration to create from scratch.
